# Issue Tracker
ForestBukkit's goal is to provide a great gameplay experience for everyone.

All development is done by the members you can see on our page. No development is rushed, and it is overlooked to make sure it is done properly and thoroughly. We push regular updates introducing new features, bug fixes and balance changes regularly.

ForestBukkit mostly only works in Java / Kotlin, we are however always adding to our skill set.
